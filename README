NAME
    Curses::UI::Mousehandler::GPM - Curses::UI GPM Bindings

SYNOPSIS
      use Curses::UI::Mousehandler::GPM;

      if (gpm_enable) {
        print "Succesfully enabled GPM mouse events\n";
      } else {
        print "Couldn't enable GPM mouse events\n";
      }

      while (1) {
        my $MEVENT = gpm_get_mouse_event();
        if ($MEVENT) {
            my ($id, $x, $y, $z, $bstate) = unpack("sx2i3l", $MEVENT);
            my %MEVENT = (
                          -id     => $id,
                          -x      => $x,
                          -y      => $y,
                          -bstate => $bstate
                          );
            print "Got mouse event at $x,$y\n";
        }
      }

REQUIREMENTS
    You will need curses.h (from a curses-devel package) and gpm.h (from a
    gpm-devel or libgpm-devel package) in order to compile. Libgpm is needed
    to bind against it. A running GPM is not really needed but might be
    usefull :-).

DESCRIPTION
    Curses::UI::Mousehandler::GPM is a module to allow GPM style mouse
    events in Curses::UI.

EXPORT
    gpm_enable
        Tries to connect to GPM. Returns a true value on success, false
        otherwise.

    gpm_get_mouse_event
        Selects for a mouse event in the GPM queue and returns it in an
        ncurses compatible MEVENT struct. If no mouse event is found undef
        will be returned. The call is non blocking.

SEE ALSO
    ncurses(3NCURSES) gpm(8)
